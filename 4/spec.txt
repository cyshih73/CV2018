Write programs which do binary morphological dilation, erosion, opening, closing, and hit-and-miss transform on a binary image 

Mathematical Morphology - Binary Morphology

	Please use the octogonal 3-5-5-5-3 kernel.
	Please use the "L" shaped kernel (same as the text book) to detect the upper-right corner for hit-and-miss transform.
	Please process the white pixels (operating on white pixels).

	Due date: 2018/10/23 2:20pm

	5 images should be included in your report: Dilation, Erosion, Opening, Closing, and Hit-and-Miss
	As a reminder, please do not copy homework, and use any library calls except for basic image IO.! You are expected to do it yourself!!
