HW2
Write a program to generate:
    a binary image (threshold at 128)
    a histogram
    connected components (regions with + at centroid, bounding box)

Basic Image Manipulation
    Binarize Lena with the threshold 128 (0-127,128-255).

    You must not use any availiable libraries beyond image I/O (reading or writing image files from/to the disk/memory). You must do all the requirements by writing your own code (called hardcore programming). This includes binarizing the image, calculating the histogram and finding the connected components.

    You have to draw the histogram. The part where you calculate the histogram must be done hardcored, but you may output your statistics data to a file and use auxiliary program to assist you in drawing the bar graphs, i.e., Excel, gnuplot, sigmaplot, matlab.

    For the connected components, please use 500 pixels as a threshold. Omit regions that have a pixel count less than 500.

    Grading policy

        Please note whether you used 4-connected or 8-connected neighborhood detection in your report. They will produce different outcomes.

        Please read "Regulation #3". Those materials should be contained in your report, and it will be the primary basis for which I will grade your work.

        Please do hardcore programming. Calling libraries beyond image file IOs are strictly prohibited! Doing so will void your homework.

        Tip: If you find that drawing a cross in the bounding box annoying, you may omit doing so. I will only look at your bounding box (since it is sufficient for deciding a region).
