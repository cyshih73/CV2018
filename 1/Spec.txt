HW1
1. Use B_PIX to write a program to generate
    (a)  upside-down lena.im
    (b)  right-side-left lena.im
    (c)  diagonally mirrored lena.im
2. Use Photoshop to
    (a) rotate lena.im 45 degrees clockwise
    (b) shrink lena.im in half
    (c) binarize lena.im at 128 to get a binary image

Basic Image Manipulation
    You may use any programming language of your choice to 
        implement the functions required in assignment #1, 
        provided that you do not use any library calls except 
        for basic image IO (e.g. OpenCV).

    For part 2, you can use any image processing software. 
    In your report, you must specify which software you used 
        and the steps you took to obtain the required results.
    You must use the image 'lena' as your benchmark.

    Grading policy
    Failing to provide a report will reduce your grade by 1~2 levels.
    Using restricted functions within your program (unless specified, as in part 2) will result in a failure of your work.

    Hint: You can use any program language to implement homework. However don't just call libraries, if just call libraries you will get zero point.
