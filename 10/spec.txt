Zero Crossing Edge Detection

You are to implement 2 Laplacian Mask, Minimum Variance Laplacian, Laplacian of Gaussian, and Difference of Gaussian(inhibitory sigma=1, excitatory sigma=3, kernel size 11x11 [1][1])
Please list the kernels and the thresholds (for zero crossing) you used.
You may generate the Difference of Gaussian kernel in anyway you like. This formula is actually Gaussian(0,1) - Gaussian(0,3).

Threshold Values listed below are for reference:
	(僅供參考，同學可自己找出 Edge Image 品質最佳的門檻值threshold value)
	Laplace Mask1 (0, 1, 0, 1, -4, 1, 0, 1, 0): 15
	Laplace Mask2 (1, 1, 1, 1, -8, 1, 1, 1, 1)
	Minimum variance Laplacian: 20
	Laplace of Gaussian: 3000
	Difference of Gaussian: 1
